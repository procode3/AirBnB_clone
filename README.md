# Airbnb clone

The 1st version of the AirBnb clone has a basemodel that handles three instance variable id, created_at and updated_at. All the other model classes inherit from the basemodel.

## DB
The curent database is a json file that stores serialized data.

## Engine
The engine that handles serialization, the FileStorage class uses json dump and json load to write and read the file

## Console
The console is used to test the creation and serialization of files in a CLI.

## Running the console
In the root folder run
```bash
$ ./console
```
